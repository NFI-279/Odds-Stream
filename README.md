# **OddsStream Sportsbook**

## **Project Overview**

**OddsStream** is a sportsbook web application designed primarily for sports traders, bookmakers, and supervisors. This project serves as a portfolio piece to showcase front-end development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Firebase used for authentication, database management, and storage.

The application allows traders to manage and update betting odds in real-time, oversee match outcomes, and control the registration process. Future enhancements will include integration with legal and free APIs to automate odds updates and provide more robust features.

## **Project Purpose**

The purpose of this project is to build a fully functional sportsbook management platform that allows:
- Sports traders to create and manage game events, update scores, and control odds.
- Senior traders to monitor trader activities and make high-level decisions.
- Admins to control user access and permissions.

The project is designed with scalability in mind, with plans to later integrate server-side logic using Node.js or Django for real-time processing and further enhancements.
